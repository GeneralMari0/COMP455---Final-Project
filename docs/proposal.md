## Problem
The amount of information that we have to deal with on a daily basis is becoming more and more overwhelming
everyday. This problem is especially apparent when making decisions about products. Since there are so many
diffent options for each category, it's extremely difficult to decide on which one to get.

I recently experienced this personally, when I tried getting back into reading. I was an avid reader when I
was younger, but slowly started reading less as I got older and busier with other stuff. However, when I
tried to figure out what book I wanted to start with, I couldn't come to a decision. Since there is so much
information, and much of it is scattered in various places, it's really hard to parse.

## Solution
We will develop a web-based catalogue of books that users that easily and quickly search through.
Throughout the whole process, we will focus on two requirements: **user-friendliness** and **speed**.
These principles will guide our decision making process, down to the smallest detail.
